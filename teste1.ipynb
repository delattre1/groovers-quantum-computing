    "## Choosed algorithm: Grover's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications and limitations\n",
    "Grover's algorithm, along with variants like amplitude amplification, can be used to speed up a broad range of algorithms. In particular, algorithms for NP-complete problems generally contain exhaustive search as a subroutine, which can be sped up by Grover's algorithm. The current best algorithm for 3SAT is one such example. Generic constraint satisfaction problems also see quadratic speedups with Grover. These algorithms do not require that the input be given in the form of an oracle, since Grover's algorithm is being applied with an explicit function, e.g. the function checking that a set of bits satisfies a 3SAT instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's algorithm can also give provable speedups for black-box problems in quantum query complexity, including element distinctness and the collision problem (solved with the Brassard–Høyer–Tapp algorithm). In these types of problems, one treats the oracle function f as a database, and the goal is to use the quantum query to this function as few times as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cryptography\n",
    "Grover's algorithm essentially solves the task of function inversion. Roughly speaking, if we have a function {\\displaystyle y=f(x)}y=f(x) that can be evaluated on a quantum computer, Grover's algorithm allows us to calculate {\\displaystyle x}x when given {\\displaystyle y}y. Consequently, Grover's algorithm gives broad asymptotic speed-ups to many kinds of brute-force attacks on symmetric-key cryptography, including collision attacks and pre-image attacks. However, this may not necessarily be the most efficient algorithm since, for example, the parallel rho algorithm is able to find a collision in SHA2 more efficiently than Grover's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "Grover's original paper described the algorithm as a database search algorithm, and this description is still common. The database in this analogy is a table of all of the function's outputs, indexed by the corresponding input. However, this database is not represented explicitly. Instead, an oracle is invoked to evaluate an item by its index. Reading a full database item by item and converting it into such a representation may take a lot longer than Grover's search. To account for such effects, Grover's algorithm can be viewed as solving an equation or satisfying a constraint. In such applications, the oracle is a way to check the constraint and is not related to the search algorithm. This separation usually prevents algorithmic optimizations, whereas conventional search algorithms often rely on such optimizations and avoid exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major barrier to instantiating a speedup from Grover's algorithm is that the quadratic speedup achieved is too modest to overcome the large overhead of near-term quantum computers. However, later generations of fault-tolerant quantum computers with better hardware performance may be able to realize these speedups for practical instances of data.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Grover's algorithm demonstrates the capability of searching unordered databases with superior speed. This algorithm can speed up an unstructured search problem quadratically, but its uses extend beyond that; it can serve as a general trick or subroutine to obtain quadratic run time improvements for a variety of other algorithms. This is called the **amplitude amplification trick**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are given a large list of N items. Among these items there is one item with a unique property that we wish to locate; we will call this one the winner w. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the w using classical computation, one would have to check on average N/2 of these items, and in the worst case, all of them. Using Grover's amplitude amplification trick we can find the marked item in roughly √N steps with. A quadratic speedup is a substantial time-saver for finding items in long lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the algorithm does not use the list's internal structure, which makes it generic; this is why it immediately provides a quadratic quantum speed-up for many classical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amplitude Amplification \n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the list, any guess of where the w is would be as good as any other, wich can be expressed in terms of the following superposition:\n",
    "|s⟩=1√N∑N−1x=0|x⟩.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at this point we were to measure in the standard basis  {|x⟩}\n",
    " , this superposition would collapse, according to the fifth quantum law, to any one of the basis states with the same probability of  \n",
    "1N=12n . Our chances of guessing the right value  w  is therefore  1  in  2n , as could be expected. Hence, on average we would need to try about  N/2=2n−1  times to guess the correct item\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the procedure called amplitude amplification, which is how a quantum computer significantly enhances this probability. This procedure stretches out (amplifies) the amplitude of the marked item, which shrinks the other items' amplitude, so that measuring the final state will return the right item with near-certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm has a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of two reflections, which generate a rotation in a two-dimensional plane. The only two special states we need to consider are the winner \n",
    "|w⟩  and the uniform superposition  \n",
    "|s⟩\n",
    " . These two vectors span a two-dimensional plane in the vector space  \n",
    "CN.  They are not quite perpendicular because  |w⟩\n",
    "  occurs in the superposition with amplitude  \n",
    "N−1/2  as well. We can, however, introduce an additional state  \n",
    "|s′⟩\n",
    "  that is in the span of these two vectors, which is perpendicular to  |w⟩  and is obtained from  |s⟩  by removing  |w⟩  and rescaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about the Amplitude Amplification operation can be found at [qiskit reference](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/algorithms/06_grover.html#Amplitude-amplification)\n",
    "\n",
    "And from the explanation on the reference we get that in the case that there are multiple solutions (M), it can be shown that roughly  \n",
    "√(N/M)  rotations will suffice.\n",
