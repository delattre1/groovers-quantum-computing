# Challenge

The objective of this project will be to propose quantum algorithms for difficult problems to solve with Classical Computing. It will be divided into two parts:

- (PART I) describe a boolean or phase oracle to map the problem to the quantum domain and identify which of its points can be optimized by quantum parallelism mechanisms
- (PART II) implement quantum parallelism in quantum simulators and real quantum computers
A rather extensive list of difficult problems can be found at the link below:

List of [NP-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems)

## What should be done in the first part of the project?

1. Choose a problem that is not known to have an efficient solution with Classical Computing
2. Describe the computational difficulty of solving the problem
3. Describe a boolean or phase oracle (not yet optimized) to generate solutions to the problem
