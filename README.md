# Challenge

The objective of this project will be to propose quantum algorithms for difficult problems to solve with Classical Computing. It will be divided into two parts:

- (PART I) describe a boolean or phase oracle to map the problem to the quantum domain and identify which of its points can be optimized by quantum parallelism mechanisms
- (PART II) implement quantum parallelism in quantum simulators and real quantum computers
A rather extensive list of difficult problems can be found at the link below:

List of [NP-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems)

## What should be done in the first part of the project?

1. Choose a problem that is not known to have an efficient solution with Classical Computing
2. Describe the computational difficulty of solving the problem
3. Describe a boolean or phase oracle (not yet optimized) to generate solutions to the problem


## What should be done in the first part of the project?
1. Use your quantum representation (Project Part I) to propose an efficient solution with Quantum Computing
2. Describe your quantum solution
3. Test your quantum solution in both quantum simulators and real devices
4. Compare time execution among classical solution and quantum simulators and real devices

The above steps must be submitted in the form of a Python notebook by the established date.
